# Data Routing Optimization

This project presents an innovative system for optimizing data routing in computer networks, developed as a final project for the COP 4530 class.

## Features

- Utilizes a stack to trace the routing path of data packets across the network, allowing for efficient route tracking and robust error handling.
- Employs a binary search tree to manage network nodes and their connections, enabling rapid lookup and selection of optimal paths for data routing.
- Applies Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the shortest path between network nodes, ensuring efficient data packet travel from source to destination.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
make
```

3. Run the compiled program using the following command:

```bash
